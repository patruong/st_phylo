Comparison of CNV Modeling Approaches: Current Log-Normal vs. CTMC
Current Log-Normal Approach
Strengths:

Continuous nature: The log-normal distribution allows for continuous values, which is appropriate for CNV data.
Flexibility: Can capture asymmetric distributions of CNV changes.
Simplicity: Relatively straightforward to implement and understand.

Limitations:

Lack of state discretization: May not capture discrete copy number states effectively.
Time-reversibility: Log-normal transitions may not be time-reversible, which could be problematic for some phylogenetic analyses.
Parameter interpretation: The biological meaning of μ and σ may not be as intuitive as rate parameters in a CTMC.

CTMC Approach for CNV Data
Potential advantages:

State discretization: Can model transitions between discrete copy number states more explicitly.
Time-reversibility: CTMCs are typically time-reversible, which is often assumed in phylogenetic models.
Rich theoretical framework: CTMCs are well-studied in phylogenetics, with many existing tools and methods.

Challenges:

Discretization of continuous data: CNV data is inherently continuous, so discretization might lose information.
State space complexity: The number of possible CNV states could be large, leading to a complex rate matrix.
Model complexity: Might require more parameters, potentially leading to overfitting.

Implementing a CTMC for CNV Data
To model CNV data with a CTMC, you could:

Discretize CNV values into states (e.g., 0, 1, 2, 3, 4+ copies).
Define a rate matrix Q for transitions between these states.
Calculate transition probabilities using P(t) = exp(Qt).
Modify the likelihood function to use these discrete states and transition probabilities.
